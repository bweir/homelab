# pi-cluster-ubuntu-server-kubeadm

My first attempt at provisioning a bare metal Pi cluster from scratch.

I used Ansible for system-level provisioning, Kubeadm to bring up the cluster,
and Terraform to provision cluster apps. The host OS is Ubuntu Server.

- [Cluster setup with Ansible](ansible/)

- [App installation with Terraform](ansible/)
